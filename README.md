# Pick Book (Cyber Security Project Edition)

### Description
"Pick Book" is a flask application that uses bootstrap for a book club. The application includes a login system and an admin page that is restricted to normal users. The inputs are protected from path traversal attacks to prevent unauthorized access. Sensitive data sent to the server is encrypted using strong cryptographic encryptions and the keys are hidden from the source code to protect against cryptanalysis. The data retrieval parameters are protected from both SQL and XSS injections to prevent data breaches. The application also has a feature to limit false login attempts by restricting users who try to enter a wrong password more than 3 times or more in 1 minute from submitting any more requests for 10 minutes. The application also includes an image upload feature that only accepts image extensions and has size limitations. Two-factor authentication is also applied to the login system to ensure that the person accessing the account is the one claiming to be. Passwords are also hashed in the database for added security.
